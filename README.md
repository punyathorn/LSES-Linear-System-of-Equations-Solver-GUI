# LSES-Linear-System-of-Equations-Solver-GUI
Python GUI program for solving 2 linear system of equations using matrices (Cramer's rule) way, and graphs the linear equations in a graph using matplotlib.
Make sure your tkinter is working properly and don't forget to install matplotlib into your python via pip install matplotlib.
